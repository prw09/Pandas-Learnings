# Pandas DataFrame Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive guide to working with **Pandas DataFrames** in Python. It covers fundamental operations such as creating DataFrames, performing data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization, along with other advanced features available in Pandas.

## Contents

The notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Introduction to Pandas**:  
   An overview of the Pandas library, its installation, and basic usage for handling tabular data in Python.

2. **Creating DataFrames**:  
   Demonstrates multiple methods to create DataFrames from lists, dictionaries, and reading from CSV/Excel files.

3. **Indexing and Slicing Data**:  
   Covers techniques for accessing rows and columns using `.loc[]`, `.iloc[]`, and other slicing methods.

4. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Handling missing data using `.isna()`, `.dropna()`, and `.fillna()`.
   - Dropping duplicates.
   - Data type conversion and handling invalid data.

5. **Data Manipulation**:  
   - Sorting and filtering data.
   - Merging and concatenating DataFrames.
   - Grouping and aggregation using `.groupby()`.

6. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Basic plotting using Pandas integrated plotting functions.
   - Visualizing trends, correlations, and distribution of data.

7. **Exporting Data**:  
   Shows how to export DataFrames into CSV, Excel, and other formats for reporting and sharing.

## Prerequisites
