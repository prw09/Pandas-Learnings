Pandas Series Notebook
Overview
This notebook provides an introduction to Pandas Series, a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type, such as integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc. The notebook contains examples and code snippets that demonstrate how to work with Pandas Series for data manipulation, analysis, and transformation.

Contents
The notebook covers the following topics:

Creating a Pandas Series:
From Python lists, NumPy arrays, and dictionaries.
Setting custom indices.
Accessing and Modifying Series Elements:
Accessing elements by index label and integer location.
Modifying individual elements and slices of the series.
Basic Operations on Series:
Element-wise operations.
Mathematical functions on series data.
Filtering and condition-based operations.
Handling Missing Data:
Introduction to handling missing or NaN values in a series.
Vectorized Operations:
Applying operations on a series using vectorized methods.
Statistical Operations:
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) using built-in Pandas functions.
